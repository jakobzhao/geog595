4. Yifu Tuan (1976) vs. Torsten Hagerstand (1978)
5. Alexander von Humboldt vs. Wihelm von Humboldt

8. Ihde has, from a phenomenological perspective, characterized this mediating role of artifacts in terms of what he calls technological intentionality (Ihde 1990, 141). By this he means that technologies – like consciousness for Husserl – have a certain directionality, an inclination or trajectory that shapes the ways in which they are used.
9. The essence of technology: revealing (pp. 12) vs. enframing.
10. Standing-reserve (Bestand, pp17, pp19)
